More Info of a movie
Any TV that can be connected to the internet is a smart TV. A user can stream media services and run apps, browse the internet, access internet music channels, shop online, and access on-demand video services. Some smart TVs include voice-recognition virtual assistant services, like Amazon&#39;s Alexa, to help switch channels, modulate volume, and search programs.
